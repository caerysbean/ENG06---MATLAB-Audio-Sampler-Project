# ENG06---MATLAB-Audio-Sampler-Project

This is our Matlab Audio Sampler Project for the UC Davis Engineering Problem Solving Class (ENG 06).

This audio sampler can load up to 9 audio files and plot the audio. It allows the user to edit the audio in various ways, such as reversing it, controlling volume, controlling playback speed, adding delay, filtering, and equalizing. The user can also generate a pure tone, plot it, and save it. They can choose the pure tone frequency through a keyboard for the sine wavefunction and choose between wavefunctions. They may also edit the length of a file and save it.
